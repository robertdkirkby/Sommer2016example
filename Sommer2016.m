% Replication of Sommer (2016) - Fertility Choice in a life cycle model with idiosyncratic uninsurable earnings risk
% WARNING: This will not actually give the results of Sommer (2016) as the
% parameter h_j (deterministic component of earnings that depends on age)
% has been lost to the sands of time.
% WARNING: The grids are small, especially the one on assets. You will need
% to increase the grid size if you want accurate results. This code is
% intended more as illustration.

% NOTE: Around line 110 I fit an exponential function, you will need the Matlab 'Curve Fitting Toolbox' to run this.

% Note: I do not have the original values of h_j, the (age-dependent) deterministic
% component of ('hourly') wages. I use a similar calibrated term from
% Kaplan (2012) but of course this is not the same thing and so is not
% going to deliver the exact same answers. (Sommer, 2016, calls this h_t.
% She explains how to calculate it from the data but does not report the
% acutal values.)

% Note: Sommer (2016) reports 'psi' as the 'preference scale' relating to
% children, but in the utility function (bottom page 33) it is denote zeta.
% I follow the utility function and call it zeta here.

% Comment: because infertile is an absorbing state in principle what you
% should do is first solve the infertile problem, and then solve the fertile
% problem. VFI Toolkit cannot handle this level of subtlety and so it is
% just going to solve the fertile and infertile and the same time and put
% lots of zeros for the probability of infertile-->fertile when calculating
% expections. This is a little wasteful computationally but we get away with it :)

% Comment: Sommer (2016) Appendix seems to say she does pure discretization (which
% is what VFI Toolkit does). She says she uses 7 grid points for epsilon
% and 2 for upsilon; I switch to 3 for upsilon as that is minimum for Farmer-Toda discretization. 
% She simulated the agents distribution based on 10,000 household simulations. 
% She does not mention number of grid points used for assets, spending-on-child, and leisure.

% Preferences

                         % 1-p being the probability the child leaves home.  Looking at how equation 4 would evolve if the 
                         % probability of staying home was 0.02 (almost all households instanly drop to 0 children) I am

%% Wage process
% w follows an exogenous process with three components: deterministic, persistent, and transitory
%
% The deterministic is a age-dependent polynomial (Sommer (2016) explains
% how she gets this, but since the numbers are not reported I was lazy and
% just used the one from Kaplan (2012) which serves a similar purpose.)
% The persistent and transitory are easy enough.
% Because the mean of the Kaplan (2012) values do not fit, I renormalize so
% that mean earnings are equal to 2/3rds of 2004 GDP per capita (2/3 is
% roughly the labor share). This is all rather lazy of me but I don't feel
% like going and doing all the CPS data (with associated complicated
% weights) just to get a deterministic age profile for an example code.
%
% h_j, the age-dependent deterministic component of wages
% Params.h_j= % Sommer (2016) calls this h_t, but I rename to h_j to fit VFI Toolkit convention of using j for age/period
%   Sommer (2016), pg 33: "The average age-profile for wages, h(t), is calculated from the 2004 CPS by 
%   dividing the family labor income, defined as a sum of yearly earnings of both spouses in husbandâ€“wife 
%   families, by the sum of total hours worked by the couple. The average age of the couple is taken to 
%   represent the age of the household. The profile is smoothed using a cubic polynomial in age."
% This would be a pain as you need to use the CPS weights, so instead I just take the values used by 
% Kaplan (2012). Since Kaplan (2012) numbers start at age 29 I just use a
% linear trend on 29-35 to backfill to age 18. This is not a good idea, but
% I just want to get this done. I also double the age 64 number as Kaplan
% has retire at 65, while Sommer has retire >65.

a_grid=200*linspace(0,1,n_a).^3'; % the power of 3 means points are denser at low asset levels which is where value function has most curvature and so tends to be good for accuracy

% In principle, the grid on fertility is just
% f_grid=[0,1]; % 0=infertile, 1=fertile

% requires the grid to also be set up as age-dependent (even though in this

f_grid_J=[0;1].*ones(1,N_j); % 0=infertile, 1=fertile
% Sommer (2016) does not report the actual values of the transition
% probabilities. She does clearly explain how they were calculated so that
% is now repeated here. First, we get the data points from Trussell &
% Wilson (1985, https://doi.org/10.1080/0032472031000141486 ) that she
% shows in Figure 1 on pg 32. These are
TW1985values=[7.0,13.1,23.1,34.5,57.6,95.2]';
TW1985ages=[20,25,30,35,40,45]';
% Reading Trussell & Wilson (1985) with an eye to finding something that
% looks like Fig 1 of Sommer (2016) it looks to me like she uses Figure 2,
% the line corresponding to women who married at age 15-19. This curve
% appears to be identical to that in Fig 1 of Sommer (2016). Footnote of
% the TW1985 figure says that the source for this is Tables 4 and 8 of
% their paper. In Table 8 of TW1985, this seems to correspond to the first
% row, so I here use those numbers. Sommer (2016) has first point in her
% figure as age 20, this appears to correspond to the 20-24 age grouping of
% TW1985 (so skip past first entry of row 1 with corresponds to age 15-19).
% Next step is Sommer (2016) reports fitting an exponentional function of
% age to this.
expf = fit(TW1985ages,TW1985values,'exp1'); % NOTE: You need the Matlab 'Curve Fitting Toolbox' to run this

% Sommer (2016) then sets the transition probabilities for f, which she

% that the fraction of permanently infertile households of any given age in
% the model matches exactly the corresponding fraction in the data. In the
% data about 97 percent of all couples are infertile at age 45. In the
